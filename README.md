# nwebdav
.NET implementation of the WebDAV protocol

## Overview
I needed a WebDAV server implementation for C#, but I couldn't find an implementation that fulfilled my needs. That's why I wrote
my own implementation.

__Requirements__
* Fast, scalable, robust with moderate memory usage.
* Abstract data store, so it can be used for directories/files but also for any other data.
* Allows for HTTP authentication and SSL support.

## Work in progress
This module is currently work-in-progress and shouldn't be used for production use yet. If you want to help, then let me know...
